<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--  The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

Tip: Always add the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to your HTML documents, so that the browser knows what type of document to expect. -->
 <html>
    <!--  The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
    The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
    The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag). -->
 <head>
    <!--The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.

    The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.

    The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

    <title> (this element is required in an HTML document)
    <style>
    <base>
    <link>
    <meta>
    <script>
    -->
    <title>WEB2 - CSS</title>
        <!-- title defines a title in the browser toolbar
        provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        displays a title for the page in search-engine results
        -->
    <meta charset = "utf-8">
        <!-- meta : The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable. -->
        <!-- <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <h2>Hello CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets", target="_blank", title="CSS specification">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>

    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
