<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--  The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

***** Tip: Always add the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to your HTML documents,
so that the browser knows what type of document to expect. -->
 <html>
    <!--  The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
    The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
    The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag). -->
 <head>
    <!--The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.

    ***** The <head> element can include
    a title for the document,
    scripts,
    styles,
    meta information, and more.
    for the for the body ****


    The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

    <title> (this element is required in an HTML document)
    <style>
    <base>
    <link>
    <meta>
    <script>
    -->
    <title>WEB3 - JavaScript</title>
        <!-- title defines a title in the browser toolbar
        provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
        displays a title for the page in search-engine results
        -->
    <meta charset = "utf-8">
        <!-- meta : The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable. -->
        <!-- <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <h2>Hello JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)", target = "blank", title = "JAVAspecification">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</a>
    [8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>

    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
